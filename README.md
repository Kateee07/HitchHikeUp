## General Info
- A web application for hitchhikers that offers viewing ride-catching spots added and rated by others, and also offers adding spots or comments (with ratings) for existing spots by oneself, everything powered by Google Maps.
- The reason for creating this program was to practice new technologies learned on the course (i.a. Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf), practice code writing, and team working.
- The reason for choosing an idea for the app was strong convinction, that as soon-to-be developers we should face the problem of creating app, that utilizes third-party API, such as Google Maps API.
